Hot and close. Marched this day nearly 30 miles-  a terrible march indeed. This is the first day in nearly a month that we have had no fighting Our line of march has been near Hanover Junction toward the Pamunky River by a devious line. Passed some fine country and well cultivated plantations on the way    The Division straggled very much on the march in consequence of much rapid marching and excessive duty for days previously.')

Suffered terribly from my operation yesterday the ball having passed through the flesh of the hip going also entirely through the Ilium bone from this point the surgeon has been unable to trace it, but I know what he thinks. He thinks that it has passed into the bowels and that I will die.')
